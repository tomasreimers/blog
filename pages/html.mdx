# HTML: The structure of web pages

HTML started as a portable markup language to share academic papers with other people on the same network. Browsers were co-developed as a way to (1) fetch those files, and (2) display them. 

While the web has changed a lot since then, that core technologies haven't. When you navigate to a URL like `google.com/foo/bar.html`, the browser requests the shared file `foo/bar.html` from the server at `google.com`; if you specify a folder path without a file, the browser will automatically request `index.html` on your behalf (specifically, the requests `google.com/foo/` and `google.com/foo/index.html` are the same).

## A basic page

The most basic HTML page you could write looks something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Demo app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we're creating a page that has a single paragraph, `<p>`, with the text "Hello, world!".

HTML is a subset of XML, that is to say it encodes the document as a tree of tags; tags can be `<opening>`, `</closing>`, or `<both />`. Every opening tag must have a closing tag, and opening and self-closing tag (what we referred to as "both") can have attributes that change the behavior of the tag (for example, `<img width="800" />` is an image with a `width` of `800px`). 

A tag nested within another tag is referred to as a child, and the outer tag is referred to as the parent:

```html
<parent>
  <child />
</parent>
```

Building on that, the entire nomenclature for family trees applies (there are grandparents, siblings, descendents, etc...)

HTML documents begin with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration that tells the parser the document is HTML (much like a shebang in a scripting language), and consist of at most two children:

- `head`: defining the metadata of the document (such as the tab's title)
- `body`: defining the contents of the document (such as the paragraph with the text hello world to show)

## Tags, tags, tags

If you were to only know 2 other tags beyond `<html>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` they would definitely be:

- `<div>`: an arbitrary block of content
- `<span>`: a way to select text within a block

We'll talk about both of these more in the CSS section.

There are other common tags to add functionality to the page: `<img>` for images, `<video>` for videos, `<textarea>` for long-form text-input, but we don't need to understand those yet. There are also other tags that encode the *purpose* of the element: `<main>`, `<article>`, `<header>` (these act the same as a div, but allow bots and accessibility software to more easily read the webpage). My advice with these semantic elements is to use them where you can, but not to stress about them; there are still many, many websites that get along just fine with divs. 

## Try it yourself

To play with this further, you can use a service like JSFiddle or CodePen, which injects the HTML directly into the body tag (and allows you to define CSS and JS files, but more on that later).

## Media

In addition to HTML, browsers can render and embed a variety of media files to make documents more rich. For example, they can handle a variety of images: 

- JPEG: Lossy image files
- PNG: Lossless image files
- WEBP: Google-optimized image files
- SVG: Vector files

They can also natively embed audio and video through MP4s.
