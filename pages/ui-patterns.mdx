# UI patterns: transcending style

As you start to look at more mocks through the lens of frontend development, you'll notice patterns and concepts that transcend the specific style. While different places call these elements different things, the goal of this chapter is to provide you with a vocabulary for some of the more common patterns.

## Layouts

Most web pages have some content at the top (called a header), some content in the middle, and some content at the bottom of the page (called a footer). If the header or footer follow you as you scroll, they are referred to as sticky (e.g. a sticky header). 

In addition, many sites have a column to the side of the content (typically used for navigation): a sidebar. 

<Excalidraw contents={LayoutJSON} />

## Containers 

Beyond the overall layout of the page, there are various types of containers for other content.

A section is probably the most generic term and refers to any part of the page. A panel is a section that is well defined (has a border or distinct background). A card is a panel that is stand-alone and typically appears elevated above the content. A drawer is a card or panel that the user can click on to expand, and an [accordion](https://vercel.com/design/collapse) is a stack of drawers.

A banner spans the width of the page (or almost the width) and informs the user of something. A callout is the same, but not at the top of the page. 

### Tabs

Sometimes you have many different pieces of content that need to fit in the same section:

- If you can click on labels to see that different content, you have [tabs](https://vercel.com/design/tabs)
- If the different content automatically cycles between itself, you have a carosel. 

### Fullscreen experiences

If you display something above the content that disables interaction with things below it, it's called a [modal](https://vercel.com/design/modal). 

If the modal is attached to the side of the screen it's called a sidepanel. 

If it comes from the bottom of the screen (common on mobile), it's called a bottom sheet. 

## Text content

Within text, there are many common elements, my recommendation is to look at a [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for examples of: 

- headings
- paragraphs
- block quotes 
- tables 
- lists
- etc. 

## Dynamic data

When dealing with user-provided data, two common states developers need to handle with are:

- An error state: when the data can not be fetched or rendered, and 
- An empty state: when there is no data; also called a null state

### Loaders 

While data is being fetched, the user needs to know that data is being fetched and that the application hasn't frozen on them. A few strategies to do that are: 

- [Spinners](https://vercel.com/design/spinner): useful when it's not known how long data will take to fetch. 
- [Shimmers](https://vercel.com/design/skeleton): serves the same purpose as a spinner, but minimizes layout shift by taking the rough shape of the final content. 
- [Progress bar](https://vercel.com/design/progress): shows how much progress has been made. When fetching data for a page, it's becoming increasingly common to show at the border of the page or element. 


## Inputs

Form elements are any elements that allow the user to provide input. Some examples are: 

### Buttons

<Excalidraw widthClass="w-1/4" contents={ButtonJSON} />

A [button](https://vercel.com/design/button) is probably the most straightforward element. You click it, and something happens. 

Optionally, a button will have a chevron next to it allowing you to pick other actions. 

Like all form elements, buttons can be disabled (this means they show up as non-interactive).

### Toggles

<Excalidraw widthClass="w-1/2" contents={TogglesJSON} />

Toggles let the user pick between some predefined states. 

- [Checkbox](https://vercel.com/design/checkbox): A box that the user can check or not. 
- [Radio button](https://vercel.com/design/radio): A group of checkboxes where only one is selectable. 
- [Toggle](https://vercel.com/design/toggle): Functionally the same as a checkbox, but communicates you're turning something 

### Dropdowns

<Excalidraw widthClass="w-1/2" contents={DropdownJSON} />

Another way to let users pick between options is a [dropdown](https://vercel.com/design/select). The user clicks on a button and opens up a menu where they can select one (or more) options.

If this menu has a search box, it's called a [combobox](https://vercel.com/design/combobox). 

### Textboxes

<Excalidraw widthClass="w-1/2" contents={TextInputJSON} />

Lastly, sometimes users need a place to input text. This is a [textbox](https://vercel.com/design/input). A textbox can have somet type of validation, for example, [calendar](https://vercel.com/design/calendar), phone, or number validation (which optionally pop up additional UI). 

A textbox can autocomplete. If a textbox can autocomplete and select multiple options, it's called a [pill selector](https://paste.twilio.design/components/multiselect-combobox): as the options are usually shown as "pills" in the textbox.

If the textbox is many lines, it is called a [textarea](https://vercel.com/design/textarea). 

### Menus 

While not technically a form element, [menus](https://vercel.com/design/menu) add additional functionality without cluttering the UI. 

If a button opens an additional piece of UI (that floats above the rest of the content), this is generally called a [popover](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/popover). Popovers are frequently used to implement menus. (If, instead, the user hovers to bring up a popover, this is called a [tooltip](https://vercel.com/design/tooltip) or hovercard. These are usually informationally.)

The most common type of menu you'll see in designs is a kebab or hamburger menu (named after the icon). Typically hidden in the top right of content. Clicking this menu opens a popover.

A menu opened on right click is called a [context menu](https://vercel.com/design/context-menu). 

One specific element which is increasingly common is a [command bar](https://kbar.vercel.app/), it is usually summoned with "command k" and allows the user to pick among options (both global, and related to the currently selected element).

## Applications

As your application becomes more complex, you'll need to communicate state to the user. 

Hints that help new users onboard are called NUXs (new user experiences); while there is no specific design, a few common options are to float them in the bottom left or above the relevant UI element. 

A [toast](https://vercel.com/design/toast) is a container that pops up (hence the name; usually somewhere along the bottom of the screen), and alerts the user of something related to an action they just took. 

Lastly, [breadcrumbs](https://vercel.com/design/breadcrumbs) help the user navigate where they are (if you think of the website like a folder structure).
