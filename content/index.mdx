# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Tomas.

I have been programming for the web for 15+ years, developed reactive frontend frameworks at Facebook, and absolutely love JavaScript.  

Over the past few years, I've found myself teaching frontend development to, primarily, backend developers. I was surprised I couldn't find a quick primer on the topic, so I made this ~20-page, front-to-back readable guide in the hope that it might help others. 

I hope you like it!
